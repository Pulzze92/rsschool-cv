## 3. Summary
### My main target is to become a really professional frontend-developer. I was a financial analyst from 2014, so my experience in IT was very bit. But from the end of 2019 I've planes in the world of web-development. So, I have the real dream to become very good in IT. My strengths are: assiduity (can sit and code for more than 10 hours with couple breaks no more than 5-10 minutes), always ready to get to bottom in questions that I can not understand until I can figure it out. I can study very fast and all my free time I try to learn something new.
